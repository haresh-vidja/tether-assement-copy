### 64. Where is the batch processing implementation in the AI Worker?
**Answer:** Batch processing is in `wrk-ai-inference/workers/lib/inference-engine.js`:
```javascript
class InferenceEngine {
  constructor (worker) {
    this.batchQueue = []
    this.batchSize = 10
    this.batchTimeout = 1000
  }

  async processBatch () {
    if (this.batchQueue.length === 0) return
    
    const batch = this.batchQueue.splice(0, this.batchSize)
    const results = await Promise.all(
      batch.map(request => this.runInference(request.modelId, request.inputData))
    )
    
    batch.forEach((request, index) => {
      request.resolve(results[index])
    })
  }
}
```

### 65. Where is the configuration file structure defined for each service?
**Answer:** Configuration structure is in each service's config directory:
```json
// wrk-api-gateway/config/common.json.example
{
  "service": {
    "name": "api-gateway",
    "port": 8000,
    "version": "1.0.0"
  },
  "auth": {
    "apiKeys": [],
    "rateLimit": {
      "requestsPerMinute": 100
    }
  },
  "orchestrator": {
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 8002
  }
}
```
